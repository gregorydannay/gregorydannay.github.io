## working papers
<br/>

- **Price discrimination in a competitive market**  
  *I explore how a firm optimally uses data to price discriminate consumers in a duopoly. In a Bertrand competition with
two firms, one firm designs a signal and receives additional information about the consumers’ preferences which it then uses
for price discrimination. I show that the informed firm optimally coarses the signal in order to incentivize its competitor
to post a high price. The informational advantage grants the informed firm a higher profit while lowering the uninformed
firm’s profit and the consumer surplus*
